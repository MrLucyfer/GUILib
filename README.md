# GUILib

## Description
I am trying to build a GUI library from scratch with the help of SDL2.

The library will include: 
+ Creating Widgets
+ Styling Widgets
+ Event handling

And more...

## Building
In order to build this library you will need ``SDL2`` instal through the ``vcpkg`` manager.
Once you've installed ``SDL2`` proceed with the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/MrLucyfer/GUILib.git
cd GUILib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
